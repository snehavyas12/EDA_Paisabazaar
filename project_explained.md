# Exploratory Data Analysis on Paisabazaar Customer Data

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Paisabazaar’s customer dataset, focusing on creditworthiness and risk evaluation. Leveraging Python and industry-standard libraries such as **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn**, the analysis uncovers actionable insights into financial behavior, credit performance, and risk patterns.

The study begins with a clear problem statement: improving credit risk evaluation by identifying key demographic, financial, and behavioral factors influencing individual credit scores. The dataset, comprising 28 variables, is meticulously cleaned and standardized, including handling duplicates, null values, and outliers using techniques like Winsorization and log transformation.

Univariate and bivariate analyses are performed to visualize distributions and relationships among variables such as annual income, credit mix, loan count, payment behavior, and debt-to-income ratio. Advanced feature engineering, including calculated columns for debt-to-income and EMI-to-salary ratios, enables deeper insights into customer segments and risk profiles.

Multivariate analysis, including correlation heatmaps, highlights clusters among income, debt, and credit utilization indicators, revealing strong predictors of poor credit scores. The project demonstrates proficiency in data profiling, outlier detection, and visualization, using tools like countplot, barplot, boxplot, violinplot, and heatmap.

Key findings show that while payment and spending behavior have limited impact on credit scores, indicators like debt burden and EMI ratios are crucial for risk assessment. The analysis provides strategic recommendations for financial institutions to minimize loan defaults, optimize credit scoring frameworks, and design targeted products.

This project showcases expertise in data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical visualization, with a strong emphasis on business impact and predictive modeling foundations. The insights generated are valuable for recruiters seeking candidates skilled in data science, financial analytics, and risk management.

All code and visualizations are documented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, demonstrating end-to-end analytical workflow and reproducibility. This work is ideal for roles in data analytics, credit risk modeling, and financial services innovation.

Addition to it, **Amazon Web Services (AWS) s3 bucket** is created where the cleaned and processed csv file of the dataset is uploaded
